## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate and experienced **Senior Fullstack Software Engineer** with 6+ years of professional experience building scalable systems across front-end and back-end. From cloud infrastructure to clean UI components, I love crafting reliable, user-centered software.

Outside of work, I balance my code commits with my **side kicks** AKA my **kids** — I'm a lifelong martial artist and full-time father, always learning and teaching with heart. Whether I’m designing APIs, mentoring teammates, or teaching a roundhouse kick, I bring energy, clarity, and purpose to everything I do.
